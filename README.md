## Hater

This is a Yo clone, but instead of sending "yo", it sends hate.
The hate is defined in the backend, which Ruby on Rails. It has its own repo [here](https://github.com/scotttherobot/Hater).
There's also an iOS client in its own repo somewhere in my GH account.

Features:
* Register for an account
* Log in
* Maintain an ememies list (think: friends list, but you hate them, remember?)
* Send hate to those people by tapping them
* Gets push notifications for new hate
